/**
 * _strchr - Write a function that locates a character in a string.
 * Return: a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in
 * the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
 * --------------------------
 * Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
 * The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area
 * Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character
 * c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
 * FYI: The standard library provides a similar function:
 * strchr. Run man strchr to learn more.
 * --------------------------
 * @string: Pointer to the string to search in
 * @character: The character to search for in the string
 * -----------------------
